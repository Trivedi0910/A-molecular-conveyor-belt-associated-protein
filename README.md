# A-molecular-conveyor-belt-associated-protein
A molecular conveyor belt-associated protein controls the rotational direction of the bacterial type 9 secretion system. 
Purpose of the Code
This repository provides Python-based analysis pipelines to study Flavobacterium johnsoniae motility. Specifically, it includes:
•	Quantification of gliding speed in wild-type cells using microscopy videos.
•	Tracking of SprB-labeled adhesins to study their dynamics on the cell surface.
•	Rotational speed analysis of tethered cells to infer motor behavior.
These tools support mechanistic investigations into how a molecular conveyor belt-associated protein controls the rotational direction of the bacterial Type 9 Secretion System (T9SS).
 
Contents
•	Fj_Motility_Analysis.ipynb
Processes single-cell trajectory data, calculates gliding speed, and fits distributions (e.g., normal) to quantify population motility.
•	SprB_Speed_Tracking_Code.ipynb
Analyzes the movement of SprB-labeled adhesins.
•	Fj_Tethered_Cell_Analysis.ipynb
Tracks the rotational behavior of tethered F. johnsoniae cells and quantifies rotation rates over time.
